    "After 2021, with the global deployment of LLM solution ChatGPT, a constatation has been made : about 80% of newly published abstracts were likely to be generated by AI. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this report is not to judge whether this is good or bad news for research, knowing that although quality can be deteriored, and abstracts normalized, chatgpt opened the domain to new countries where english is not well spoken.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to train a model that could be used to detect whether an abstract is written by a real person, or by an AI tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this project is AI-GA Dataset (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ai-ga-ai-generated-abstracts-dataset), for which no benchmark has been created yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is structured under csv format : title, text, label and contains 28663 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the model we will use in the next parts needs to be under the shape of vectors, we need to preprocess each row. We use an open-source **text embedding** for that.\n",
